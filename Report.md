## Questions

1. What is the purpose of an IP address?

    It is a naming mechanism that gives each machine its own unique identity.

2. What is a DNS? What are the benefits of using domain names instead of IP addresses?

    A DNS maps a symbolic name to a corresponding IP address so that it is easier to access for people since IP addresses are hard to remember.

3. What is the difference between a static IP and a dynamic IP?

    A static IP stays the same while a dynamic IP can change. 

4. What is the tradeoff between UDP and TCP protocols?

    TCP is a more reliable form of communication, while UDP is a faster form of communication but less reliable

5. Why can't we use the delay function with Blynk?

    Blynk is event based and using a delay function would break up the timing of Blynk.

6. What does it mean for a function to be "Blocking"?

    Nothing else can run while it is running

7. Why are interrupts useful for writing Non-Blocking code?

    Interrupts only execute code needed when called and immediately return to the original program.

8. What is the difference between interface and implementation? Why is it important?

   An interface defines how a function is called and implementation describes what the function actually does.
